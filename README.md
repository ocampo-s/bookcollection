This is a prototype app for the private home book collection of a scholar or a household with more than 1000 titles.

This is a react app.
The styling is from bootstrap and react-bootstrap.
It is completely responsive.

The user can CRUD a Realtime database in Google's Firebase.

The app is now in test use as of Nov 2023.

In the near future I hope to add a dashboard that will give a general picture of the collection.
